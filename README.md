# Beginner JavaScript :rocket:  

A repository completely dedicated to building on my own understanding of JavaScript through various projects. All projects have been built with Vanilla JS. 

## Version Control with GitBash :beginner:
##### Add files to repository

    git add .
##### Commit files to Github repository

    git commit -m "message here" (message is optional, but good practice)  
##### Push files to repository

    git push -u origin master --> enter password
##### Check status of repository

    git status 
##### Update own locally stored files inline with Github repository
    git pull origin master
##### Clone a repository into own local storage
    git clone https://github.com/the-url-of-repository
